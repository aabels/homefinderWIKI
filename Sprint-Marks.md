## Comments
Positives:
1. Clear, detailed, and comprehensive user stories
2. Detailed user navigation diagrams
3. Detailed UML diagrams
4. Clear evidence of good interactions with client and team
5. Clear technical plan and API definition

Negatives:
1. your list of similar products does not clearly explain how they are similar and why we can’t just use them. You can’t assume that everyone knows what kijiji/airbnb are.
2. I believe one of the requirements was for this app to be usable on mobile. A mockup of the look and feel on mobile would have been helpful.

## Comments

Positives:

1. Well documented setup instructions in README
2. Good usage of open source libraries/frameworks


Negatives:

1. No end to end (selenium) tests?
2. More consistent naming of branches. Some are prefixed by feature, some are not. Some are the user story number, some are feature description.
3. Your README is REALLY long. Consider splitting out nonessential components into separate file(s).
4. Had a demo for frontend and backend, but no tasks for integration

## Comments

1. Compared to other teams, there was little end to end integration present, and so wildcard marks were deducted
2. Be wary of adding too many 3rd party frameworks or tools; it makes the app more brittle and more difficult to onboard new developers

# Sprint 4 Marks
- The majority of your documentation is very detailed and excellent
- However, your testing document is too sparse... I guess this is related to not finishing in time
- Marks deducted for planning
