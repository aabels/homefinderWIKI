## Brief Description

Home Finder is an enhanced home rental website specifically with roommate-matching feature. It mainly targets on university students who want to rent or sublet rooms.

## Project Description

The goal is to build a responsive website that allows post-secondary students to more reliably and accurately find roommates and accommodation in a quick and user friendly fashion. Most options today do not offer students an easy and reliable way to search for roommates and accommodation depending on their circumstances, academic goals, preferences, personality, culture, demographic or necessities. This responsive website aims to provide a one stop easy to use interface that will deliver this service to students in a quick, reliable, accurate and user friendly way. We are currently using a Facebook group for this purposes, but due to limitations in filtering, sorting, matching and overall management of listings, our users are left with a long list of postings in Facebook which they have to scroll through manually in the hope that they find the most suitable and relevant match.

### The main business outcomes are as follows

* Offer students the flexibility to specify and locate properties where they would like to live.
* Offer students the flexibility to select like-minded, suitable and vetted roommates who are also students.
* Provide a notification system to alert students whenever a match meeting their search criteria has been added, or when a match (roommate or landlord) would like to contact them.
* Move our existing user base from our Facebook group to the responsive website and use this as their primary source for finding accommodation, roommates and tenants. This is why itâ€™s important users should be able to sign in with their Facebook profile.
