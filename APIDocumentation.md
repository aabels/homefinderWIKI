For this project we are using automatcially generated documentation via `coreapi` and the django rest framework. Because this documentation is live and automatically updating, you will need to run the backend server on your machine (or another) to view the docs.

If you haven't already, follow the instructions outlined [here](https://github.com/cmput401-fall2018/homefinder/blob/master/DEVELOPMENT.md) on how to set up your development environment.

After setting up your development environment and starting the server, you can navigate in your browser to `localhost:8000/docs` to view to live documentation and interact with it.
